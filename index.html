        <h2>Magellan of interplanetary exploration</h2>
        <p>&emsp;Opportunity, otherwise known as “Oppy,” was a rover created by NASA as a part of their
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover" target="_blank">Mars Exploration
            Rover (MER)</a> program. The MER mission included two Mars rovers, both
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)" target="_blank">Opportunity</a>
          and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)" target="_blank">Spirit</a>; Spirit was
          active from <time datetime="2004">2004</time> - <time datetime="2010">2010</time>.
          In <time datetime="2003-07">July 2003</time>, the rover Oppy began its journey to Mars. It took
          Opportunity about 6 months to land on Mars, where it was expected to last roughly 90 days.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;However, Opportunity lasted 55 times longer than its expected duration. By the end of the
          rover's mission, it had lived 5,498 days (15 years) and traveled more than 28 miles (45 kilometers),
          becoming one of NASA’s most famous and endearing missions to date. Opportunity made many significant
          scientific observations throughout its ife, teaching us about Mars' ancient past as a wet,
          potentially habitable planet, and revealing uncharted Martian landscapes.

      <h2> Major timeline events from Opportunity’s 15-year mission on Mars:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><time datetime="2003-07-07">July 7, 2003</time>Opportunity launches from Earth on its journey to
          Mars to explore its surface for an estimated 90 days. The goal of the exploration was to get images
          of the planet and study its rocks with the intent to find signs of water.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2004-01-25">January 25, 2004</time>Opportunity took approximately 6 months to reach
          Mars’ surface. It landed safely in a crater that was later named the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(Meridiani_Planum_crater)" target="_blank">“Eagle
            Crater"</a>. This is where Opportunity began its journey of exploration on Mars.
        </li>
        <li><time datetime="2004-04-19">April 19, 2004</time>Just weeks after landing, Opportunity made one of
          its most well known discoveries. This was the day that the rover discovered and took images of
          small, spherical rocks composed completely of the mineral hematite. After studying these rocks,
          named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_spherules" target="_blank">“blueberries"</a>,
          it was decided that they were formed in the presence of water.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2004-05-28">May 28, 2004</time>Opportunity begins using a procedure known as “deep
          sleep." During this procedure Opportunity disconnects its batteries at night. The point of this
          process was to stop the heater from drawing power from the battery. The long life of the rover is
          often attributed to this plan of action.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2005-01">January 2005</time>Completely by coincidence, Opportunity discovers the
          first meteorite on Mars. Opportunity had been sent to examine its discarded heat shield and within
          the vicinity was the basketball sized meteorite. The meteorite was named
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_Shield_Rock" target="_blank">“Heat Shield Rock"</a>.
        </li>
        <li><time datetime="2006-09-26">September 26, 2006</time>Opportunity reaches the rim of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(crater)" target="_blank">Victoria Crater</a>.
          This is significant because Opportunity would spend approximately the next two years traveling this
          crater. While in the crater a new instrument allowed Oppy to determine how much noble gas argon was
          in the atmosphere of Mars.
        </li>
        <li><time datetime="2007-07-27">July 27, 2007</time>Dust storms that have been clouding the atmosphere
          and blocking solar power from reaching Opportunity begin to intensify. Opportunity faces a real
          possibility of system failure because of the lack of power that it could generate. During this time
          NASA stated, "We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for
          conditions this intense." Miraculously, Oppy survived and continued its journey on Mars.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2008-09">September 2008</time>Oppy begins its departure from Victoria Crater after 2
          years. It was in this crater that phyllosilicate clay-bearing rocks were discovered. The rock type
          eludes that the planets previous environment may have been more hospitable to living organisms than
          previously believed.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2009-07"></time></time><time datetime="2009-12">July 2009 – December 2009</time>Oppy
          discovers many more meteorites, making stops along its journey to capture images and samples.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2010-07">July 2010</time>Oppy has traveled further in the last two years than ever
          before. Oppy’s team names the sites at
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_(crater)" target="_blank">Endeavor Crater</a>
          after the travels of the commander of HMS Endeavour. At one of these sites Oppy helps research
          water-bearing minerals that had previously been discovered by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Reconnaissance_Imaging_Spectrometer_for_Mars"
            target="_blank">CRISM</a>.
        </li>
        <li><time datetime="2011-12">December 2011</time>Oppy analyzes the
          <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/3783/homestake-vein-in-color/" target="_blank">“Homestake”</a>
          formation and confirms that it is formed of gypsum. This research is considered the most concrete proof
          that there was a presence of water on Mars.
        </li>
        <li><time datetime="2012-01">January 2012</time>Oppy collects data from <a

          other NASA vehicle, that is not on Earth. Oppy becomes an out-of-world

        <li><time datetime="2014-01-23">January 23, 2014</time>NASA celebrates the 10th anniversary of
          Opportunitiy's landing on Mars. NASA shares a <a

            target="_blank">self portrait</a> of the rover from above. They also share some pictures of
          Martian rocks that are much older than any others shown and reveal more favorable conditions for
          microbial life.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2015-01">January 2015</time>Oppy climbs to its highest elevation yet at <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Tribulation_(Mars)" target="_blank">Cape
            Tribulation</a>. The summit of this location is said to have been 433 feet.
        </li>
        <li><time datetime="2016-01-25">January 25, 2016</time>Oppy celebrates 12 years since its landing on
          Mars. This is also the year it is declared that Oppy has traveled the distance of a marathon.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2018-06-10">June 10, 2018</time>Contact with Oppy is lost after a severe dust storm
          blocks out the Sun. NASA continues efforts to contact Oppy after the storm subsides.</li>
        <li><time datetime="2019-02-12">Feb. 12, 2019</time>This date marks the final attempt at contact. On
          Feb. 13, 2019, NASA declares Oppy dead stating that its mission is complete.</li>
